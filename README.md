## ðŸ“– Peduli Bumil - Mechine Learning
Peduli Bumil is a health application designed to help pregnant women monitor and maintain their health during pregnancy. This application provides main features such as a pregnancy age tracker, pregnancy risk detection based on health parameters (height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, age, and heart rate), as well as risk classification into High, Medium, or Low categories. In addition, this application is equipped with informative articles, an interactive chatbot to answer pregnancy-related questions,and personal reminders to maintain health.

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to analyze health data and detect pregnancy risk levels. This model is converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format to enable implementation on edge devices or mobile applications, thereby supporting broader accessibility, especially for pregnant women in remote areas. This application contributes to the Indonesian government's efforts to reduce maternal mortality rates by preventing complications and enhancing health understanding.

Pregnancy Risk Detection Model
This model uses relevant health features from the dataset to predict the level of pregnancy risk (High, Medium, Low) for users. This model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which enables high-accuracy health data analysis to support decision-making related to pregnancy care.

## Dataset
